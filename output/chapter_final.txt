Chapter 1: The Outsider's Arrival

As dawn broke, a man named Dick stood on the jagged edge of a coral reef, surveying the boundless southern seascape. The distant roar of the outer sea echoed behind him, its intensity softened by the mist that danced on the wind. Before him unfolded a tranquil scene, an ocean as serene as a placid lake, vast and azure. The cries of gulls soaring over the peaceful Karolin lagoon intertwined with the rustling whispers of the wind. This expansive body of water, encircled by forty miles of coral, was a world unto itself. It held the potential for tempestuous fury during heavy winds, yet in a gentle breeze, it transformed into a serene, azure lake. This was now his domain.

The tribe of women, children, and young men, bustling along the sun-drenched beach, engrossed in their tasks, were now his people. The canoes resting on the sandy shore, the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes, all these were now his responsibilities. His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed in deep thought. Then, with the lagoon at his back, he faced the thundering breakers of the northern sea.

Beyond the sea's edge, invisible to the naked eye, lay Palm Tree Island. An idyllic paradise that concealed a dreadful secret within its stunning beauty. Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat idly on the nearby coral, gazing up at Dick with innocent curiosity. In the absence of the men of Karolin, the women, children, and youths were left vulnerable, leaderless. And then Dick arrived, accompanied by a familiar face, Katafa, who had vanished many years ago in a storm. The tribe saw him as a divine answer to their prayers, a new chief to guide them.

Innocent and carefree, Tari asked Dick a simple yet profound question. “Taori,” said little Tari, “who are you?”

Dick could have shared his extraordinary tale. How he, Dick Lestrange, had been stranded on Palm Tree Island as a boy, younger than Tari himself. How an old sailor named Kearney raised him, teaching him to fish, spear fish, and construct unique little ships unlike anything the islanders had ever seen. How Katafa, the girl who had disappeared from Karolin, had found herself on Palm Tree Island, living with them until Kearney's death. How she taught him her language, gave him a new name, Taori, and how they fell in love. They might have lived happily on Palm Tree Island if not for the arrival of a ship crewed by malevolent men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. How these men murdered their white companions, set the ship on fire, and forced Dick and Katafa to flee in their small boat, guided by the distant glow of Karolin lagoon.

But he could not share all this with Tari. Instead, he simply replied, "I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?"
Thats all

The men, bereft of female companionship, would inevitably be attracted to the women of Karolin, just as Dick had been drawn to Katafa. Enticed by the promise of unexplored land and the allure of women, they would tirelessly scan the horizon until the light of the lagoon unveiled their destination. If only Dick had understood earlier that danger was omnipresent, not just from the north but from every direction within the expansive blue sea. His fear was not limited to savages; it also encompassed civilized men whose actions were fueled by greed, lust, and hatred.

In Dick's circumscribed world, there was no existence beyond the undulating waves that framed the twin islands. His universe was bereft of Europe, America, and history, except for his own fleeting existence and Katafa's life. However, even his restricted experience had made him cautious of men and equipped him to identify the recurring patterns in human history - the innate instincts for war, plunder, and destruction.

Gradually, the ominous image of Palm Tree started to fade until it finally vanished, as if snuffed out. As they pivoted away from the vast sea to face the lagoon, Katafa pointed towards a canoe advancing from the southern beach. This was the canoe that Dick had requested.
