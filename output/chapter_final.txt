Chapter 1: The Canoe Creator

Perched on a coral-rich ledge, Dick surveyed the south. The mighty roar of the outer sea's breakers echoed behind him, while the spindrift whirled in the wind. Before him stretched a tranquil ocean, its likeness to a lake uncanny. Its fathomless depths and mesmerizing blue hue served as a playground for fishing gulls. This was the lagoon of Karolin.

This vast aquatic enclosure, outlined by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a miniature world unto itself. It could assume the guise of a storm-tossed sea during fierce winds or transform into a soothing azure lake under gentle breezes. This was his domain, a realm he had just begun to rule.

Women, young boys, and children could be seen busily engaged in various activities along the sun-scorched beach. Whether they were fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to the paraka patches, all these individuals were his subjects. The canoes resting against the sand and the empty huts that once sheltered the war canoes were his as well.

However, as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his expression hardened. He turned to face the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree, an island of unrivaled beauty, yet riddled with malevolence.

Beside him on the coral, young Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net maker, looked up at him. Tari was innocent of worldly affairs, but he understood that the war had left their tribe without any adult males or leaders, leaving only women, boys, and children like himself to survive. Then, the mysterious newcomer had appeared from the northern sea. Accompanied by Katafa, who had been abducted years ago during a fishing expedition, the women believed this man had been sent by the gods. They had chosen him as their chief and leader.

Suddenly, Tari posed a direct question to Dick, “Who are you?”

Dick's response was straightforward, “I am Taori.”

Attracted by the shouts of the children hauling a net, Tari quickly lost interest in the conversation and scampered off.

Dick’s gaze returned north. He remembered the ship that had docked at Palm Tree, laden with malevolent men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They had slaughtered the white men and set the ship on fire. Only by sheer luck had he and Katafa escaped in their dinghy, guided by the lagoon's glow in the sky.

As he studied the horizon, he pondered the threat these men posed. It was a distant danger, but a danger nonetheless. That's why he had sent a canoe that very morning to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, the experienced canoe builders. He was also mindful that a hundred of the boys from their tribe were on the cusp of manhood.

His thoughts whirled. Was he plotting battles in the lagoon? Or contemplating a preemptive strike? Only time would reveal his plans. As he stood deep in thought, Katafa approached him, her gaze fixed on the horizon.

“Look!” she cried.

Occasionally, under certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree could be seen from Karolin through a mirage. As they stood silently together, the island began to rise again, appearing to watch them. Remembering the horrific ordeal they had escaped, an uneasy silence hung in the air. The island's ghostly image served as a stark reminder of the lurking threat in the distance.

The tragic scene unfolded before them, a beautiful sight that concealed lingering nightmares within its folds. Dick's gaze absorbed the radiant yet ominous panorama, his anger escalating at the thought of the threats against him and the innocent Katafa. The danger was far from over; threats were still rampant. He envisioned the day their adversaries would arrive.

The image of the Palm Tree seemed to amplify his fears. Allured by the lagoon's reflected light in the sky, these men, bereft of female companionship, would construct canoes and venture towards them. Dick feared that just as he was drawn to Katafa, the men would be enticed by the women of Karolin. Scanning the horizon for potential islands to conquer, they would be attracted by the lagoon's light and inevitably arrive. Dick realized that danger was not confined to the north but was pervasive wherever human vices such as greed, desire, or hatred could traverse the azure sea. This danger encompassed not only the savages but also the so-called civilized men.

To Dick, his world was confined to the aquatic boundaries of the two islands. Europe, America, and history held no significance in his existence. His life, along with Katafa's, was defined by their survival on the islands. Despite this, he had learned to fear men, grasping the fundamental elements of human history—war, looting, and destruction.

The image of the Palm Tree gradually receded, disappearing entirely in an instant as if a light had been extinguished. As their gaze shifted from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed out a canoe swiftly approaching from the southern beach. This was the canoe that Dick had dispatched to fetch the canoe builders. Departing the coral, they made their way to the white sandy beach of the lagoon to welcome them.
